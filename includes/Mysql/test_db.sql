In the 1970s techniques were devised for use by those less artistically skilled, employing interchangeable templates of separate facial features, such as \"Photofit\" in the UK, <a title=\"Smith &amp; Wesson\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Smith_%26_Wesson\">Smith &amp; Wesson</a>\'s \"Identi-Kit\" in the U.S. and PortraitPad.</p>\r\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\r\n<p>In the last two decades, a number of computer based facial composite systems have been introduced; amongst the most widely used systems are SketchCop FACETTE Face Design System Software, \"Identi-Kit 2000\", FACES, <a title=\"E-FIT\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/E-FIT\">E-FIT</a> and PortraitPad. In the U.S. the <a title=\"Federal Bureau of Investigation\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Federal_Bureau_of_Investigation\">FBI</a> maintains that hand-drawing is its preferred method for constructing a facial composite. Many other police agencies, however, use software, since suitable artistic talent is often not available.</p>\r\n<p>Until quite recently, the facial composite systems used by international police forces were exclusively based on a construction methodology in which individual facial features (eyes, nose, mouth, eyebrows, etc.) are selected one at a time from a large database and then electronically \'overlaid\' to make the composite image. Such systems are often referred to as feature-based since they essentially rely on the selection of individual features in isolation. However, after a long period of research and development work conducted largely within British Universities, systems based on a rather different principle are finding increasing use by police forces. These systems may be broadly described as holistic or global in that they primarily attempt to create a likeness to the suspect through an <a title=\"Genetic algorithm\" href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetic_algorithm\">evolutionary mechanism</a> in which a witness\'s response to groups of complete faces (not just features) converges towards an increasingly accurate image. Three such systems have come from academic beginnings, EFIT-V from the University of Kent; EvoFIT (<a class=\"external free\" href=\"http://www.EvoFIT.co.uk\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.EvoFIT.co.uk</a>) from the University of Stirling, the University of Central Lancashire (UCLan) and the University of Winchester;<sup id=\"cite_ref-Frowd_2013_89&ndash;97_5-0\" class=\"reference\"></sup> and ID from the University of Cape Town, South Africa.
